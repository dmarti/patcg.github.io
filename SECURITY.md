# Security and Privacy Issues

Reporting procedures for issues relating to security or privacy.

We request that all issues related to active work of the Private Advertising
Technology Community Group be reported as issues on the repository of the
affected specifications.

However, if you believe that disclosure of an issue might result in an increased
risk to people, please contact the editors and chairs privately.  Currently, no
procedures have been established for ensuring secure communication, see
[admin#1](https://github.com/patcg/admin/issues/1). Please avoid discussion of
details of the issue prior to arranging for secure communication.
